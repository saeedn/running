The TLDR of my [running background](https://saeedn.github.io/running/background) is that I thought it was going to be as simple as: put on shoes, run hard. Wow was that wrong, and this page captures some of what I've learned over the last couple years of learning how to run.

What I've found most interesting is that running involves several overlapping systems, and your overall performance seems to be limited by whichever of these is the weakest at any given time. I'm sure the same is true in any sport, but in biking you really can get away with: get on bike, ride hard. That approach won't take you to the top, but it'll get you pretty far. But running is both a more complex movement and is harder on the body, so it has required a much more intentional approach, for me at least.

These are the various areas I've had to think about and improve. As I chip away at each of these, they'll link out to subpages with more detailed information.

None of this is guaranteed to be in any way accurate. This is just how I've been thinking about my running, and I welcome all feedback! Just go to the [source](https://github.com/saeedn/running) and file an issue or submit an update!

* Cardiovascular
  * [Heart rate](https://saeedn.github.io/running/cardio/heartrate), HR zones, HR drift, aerobic decoupling
  * Breathing, correlation to HR zones
  * Cardio capacity, base building, run slow to run fast
  * Endurance, lactate threshold
  * Sustainable speed is just below pace at LTHR
* Biomechanical
  * Resilience, tendon strength, injury management
  * Running form
  * Cadence vs stride length
  * Forward lean, butt kickers, knee drive. Pull the ground under you, rather than push your body forward.
  * Foot landing position
  * Mobility: hips, thoracic spine
  * Speed = cadence x stride length
* Metabolic power production
  * Strength vs power
  * Critical Power, power zones, correlations to HR zones
  * Speed = power x Running Effectiveness (efficiency of converting power into forward motion)
* Fuel
  * A fast (sub-90) half marathon is borderline - you might not need fueling during the race, but you definitely need to be stocked up on fuel pre-race
  * Fueling for run vs bike vs triathlon
  * Fueling for zone 2 or 3 efforts vs zone 4 efforts
* Psychological
  * Big picture motivation
  * Daily grind
  * Race day mind game. Race day has nothing to do with fitness because on that day your fitness is a fixed quantity. Race day success is all about problem solving, triaging, remaining calm, continuing forward no matter what - it is entirely mental.
* Gear
  * Shoes
  * Watch, HRM, Power pod
  * Calf sleeves, socks, lubricating powder
  * Layers, hats, gloves
