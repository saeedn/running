* Measuring heart rate
  * Why? How?
  
* Heart rate zones
  * DO NOT USE `Max=220-Age` formula. It is statistically true, and totally useless for most individuals.
  * Finding true max heart rate is very difficult, and not really needed. Better to determine lactate threshold heart rate (LTHR)
  * LTHR testing protocols
  * Zones based on LTHR
  
* More advanced metrics
  * Aerobic decoupling, HR drift
  
* Advantages
  * Measures total body stress, regardless of external conditions
  * When using a precise LTHR, HR is a great way to ensure you stay at a sustainable effort level
  
* Disadvantages
  * Laggy indicator, doesn't react for many seconds after exertion changes
  * Nonspecific, includes many factors other than exertion (heat+humidity, altitude, sleep, caffiene, diet, sickness all affect HR)
  * Wrist-based HR is very unreliable. Chest straps are accurate but can restrict breathing.
