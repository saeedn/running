Breathing should be the simplest. I certainly never had to give it much thought in biking other than when I need more air, I breathe harder. But in running, a few things happen that I seemingly have no control over:

1. My breathing is always tied to my cadence. Each breath, in or out, always happens as a foot makes impact with the ground. I suppose it makes sense, the landing is so jarring to the body that it would be difficult to carry a smooth breath through that, so the step forms natural punctuation marks (though I'm curious to know if anyone experiences it differently than that!)
2. My breathing pattern is tied to my exertion level. When I'm going easy, the pattern is 4 breaths out, 2 breaths in. As I increase the effort, the pattern changes to 3 out, 3 in, then 2 out, 2 in, and all all out sprint effort will put me in 1 in, 1 out but not for long.
3. And the corollary of those two put together is that it is very difficult to change my cadence because it changes the duration of each breath. As I increase my cadence, it sometimes feels like I'm hyperventilating because my breathing goes in and out faster than I'm used to. This is something I'm still working on figuring out, especially since one of my goals for the coming year is to increase my cadence from the low 170's to around 190.

One very interesting thing I've observed for myself is that my breathing pattern is highly correlated to my heart rate zones. They don't always line up exactly, but on those days it's usually my heart rate that's misbehaving for some other reason. I've found that my breathing is actually a much more consistent indicator of which zone of effort I'm in at any given time.
* Zone 1: This is the only time my breath is not tied to my cadence, so it's just free flowing breath
* Zone 2: 4 breaths out, 2 breaths in
* Zone 3: 3 breaths out, 2 breaths in
* Zone 4: 2 breaths out, 2 breaths in
* Zone 5: 1 breath out, 1 breath in

All of the above is true for my current 170-175 cadence. It will be very interesting to see if I need to adjust those counts as I increase cadence to 190. Although the above counts were observed, not designed, so perhaps a new pattern will just naturally emerge at the higher cadence too.

## Mouth vs nose

I've sometimes heard it stated (more accurately, read in Instagram comments) that it's better to breathe through the nose. To be honest, I'm not sure why or if there's any merit to that. What I end up doing is out through the mouth, in the through nose AND mouth. I suspect this is just a matter of personal preference, though perhaps I need to inspect this more closely at some point.
